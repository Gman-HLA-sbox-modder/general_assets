# general_assets
My asset repo for s&amp;box. Open source for anyone to use. This also has some ported assets from various games (primarily valve titles)

Here is a quick rundown of how all of my folders are used.

Models - This includes every model in the repo and their required materials. 
I did this rather than putting them in materials so people could clone and use those seperate from my materials.

Materials - These are world textures. (Walls, Floors, Ceilings, ETC.)
